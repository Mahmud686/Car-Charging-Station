**HA1**:
Matriculation Number: 7216156
1. Develop the Station configuration for the Capstone project and also the corresponding part in the Main.java file to align the Locatio.java and Station.java file
2. Create chaining exceptions which means to relate one exception with another exception, i.e one exception describes the cause of another exception
   Handled the wrong weather status input to implement chaining exception in Hometask 1
3. Write the theory answers to Hometask 1 (question no 2.1), Hometask 2 (question no 2.1)

Matriculation Number: 7219089
1. Develop the Weather conditions and Energy sources configuration for the Capstone project and also the corresponding part in the Main.java file to align the scenario of the capstone project
2. Create Resource Management exceptions in the capstone project in Hometask 1 where the scanner is closed to reduce the usage of resources.
3. Write the theory answers to Hometask 1 (question no 2.4), and Hometask 2 (question no 2.3)
   
**HA2**:
1. Created Metadata for the CarChargingStation project
