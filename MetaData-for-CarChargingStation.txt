Here's the metadata for CarChargingStation Java project:

1. __Main Class__
   - Purpose: The main class of the application handling user inputs and interactions with charging stations and users.
   - Functionality:
     - Takes user input for station and location counts, weather conditions, user details, and manages the charging stations accordingly.
     - Handles exceptions related to input validation and station operations.


2. **Station Class**
   - Purpose: Represents a charging station with locations, energy sources, a priority queue for users, and methods for managing access and bookings.
   - Fields:
     - private List<Location> locations: Holds the locations within the station.
     - private SourceofEnergy sourceOfEnergy: Represents the energy source used by the station.
     - private Queue<User> priorityQueue: Priority queue for user access.
     - private Map<User, Integer> timeslots: Tracks timeslots booked by users.
   - Methods:
     - Various methods to manage location status, user bookings, priority queue, access control, and clearing locations.

3. Location Class
   - Purpose: Represents a location and its occupancy status for charging stations.
   - Fields:
     - private boolean occupied: Indicates whether the location is occupied or not.
   - Methods:
     - isOccupied(): Checks if the location is occupied.
     - occupy(): Marks the location as occupied.
     - release(): Releases the occupied status of the location.

4. WeatherConditions Class
   - Purpose: Simulates weather conditions and provides methods to retrieve current weather conditions.
   - Methods:
     - getWeather(): Returns the current weather condition (SUNNY, WINDY, RAINY).

5. SourceofEnergy Interface
   - Purpose: An interface defining methods for energy sources.
   - Methods:
     - provideEnergy(): To provide energy output.
     - switchSourceofEnergy(WeatherConditions.Weather weather): To switch the energy source based on weather conditions.

6. ChargingException Class
   - Purpose: A custom exception class specifically designed for handling exceptions related to charging operations or energy sources.
   - Constructors:
     - ChargingException(String message): Initializes the exception with a message.
     - ChargingException(String message, Throwable cause): Initializes the exception with a message and a cause.

7. SolarPanel Class (implements SourceofEnergy)
   - Purpose: Represents a solar panel as an energy source that can be switched on/off based on weather conditions.
   - Fields:
     - private boolean isSwitchedOn: Indicates whether the solar panel is active.
   - Methods:
     - provideEnergy(): Provides energy output based on the switched-on status.
     - switchSourceofEnergy(WeatherConditions.Weather weather): Switches the energy source on/off based on weather conditions.

8. Electricity Class (implements SourceofEnergy)
   - Purpose: Represents an electricity source of energy that can be switched on or off based on weather conditions.
   - Fields:
     - private boolean isSwitchedOn: Indicates whether the electricity source is active.
   - Methods:
     - provideEnergy(): Provides energy output based on the switched-on status.
     - switchSourceofEnergy(WeatherConditions.Weather weather): Switches the energy source on/off based on weather conditions.

9. WindTurbine Class (implements SourceofEnergy)
   - Purpose: Represents a wind turbine as an energy source that can be switched on/off based on weather conditions.
   - Fields:
     - private boolean isSwitchedOn: Indicates whether the wind turbine is active.
   - Methods:
     - provideEnergy(): Provides energy output based on the switched-on status.
     - switchSourceofEnergy(WeatherConditions.Weather weather): Switches the energy source on/off based on weather conditions. 

10. User Class
    - Purpose: Represents a user with a username and user type (ADMINISTRATOR or EXTERNAL_USER).
    - Fields:
      - private String username: Stores the username of the user.
      - private UserType userType: Indicates the type of user (ADMINISTRATOR or EXTERNAL_USER).
    - Methods:
      - getUsername(): Returns the username of the user.
      - getUserType(): Returns the type of the user.
